## Original User Request:
I want an application that enhances students' studying process. So the main idea will be an app that allows student to upload their study materials (e.g. lecture slides, their notes, etc.). Then the app will leverage AI (gemini) to perform RAG. After the LLM finished reading the materials. It will generate question cards to the user. In the fron page of the question card it will be a question based on the content of the given material. So the user will think the answer of it. After the user finish thinking the answer. Then, they can click the check the answer button and the card will flip to the back side. Also, the user can click the Next question card button for the next button. Particularly, the user can specify number of question cards that they want to generate.
